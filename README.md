## Usage

### Authentication

The Todoable API requires authentication. That can be done by
informing *user* and *password* to the constructor of the `Todoable`
class:

```ruby
require 'todoable'

todo = Todoable::Todoable.new("user", "password")
```

### Create new lists

After instantiating an instance of the `Todoable::Todoable` class, a
new list can be created like the following:

```ruby
todo.new_list("Fun things")
```

### Retrieve all lists

To retrieve all lists just use the `Todoable::Todoable.lists` method
as following:

```ruby
todo.lists()
```

The output will be a Ruby list containing instances of the class
`Todoable::List`.

### Update list title

After a list is created it's also possible to update its title. If you
have a list instance acquired the `Todoable::Todoable::lists()`
method, you can just call the method `Todoable::List::update()`
passing the new name as the only parameter:

```ruby
test_todo = Todoable::Todoable.new("user", "password")
test_todo.new_list('foo')

puts test_todo.lists()[0].name # ===> foo

test_todo.lists()[0].update('bar')

puts test_todo.lists()[0].name # ===> bar

```

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
